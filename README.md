Give me a trial!

- Install with [zplug](https://github.com/b4b4r07/zplug):

	gcloud-project can be installed by adding following to your `.zshrc` file in the same function you're doing your other `zplug load` calls in.

	```console
	$ zplug "avivl/gcloud-project", use:init.sh
	```

- Install with `git clone`:

	```console
	$ git clone https://github.com/avivl/gcloud-project
	$ source /path/to/enhancd/init.sh
	```
